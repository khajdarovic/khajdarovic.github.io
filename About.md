I am a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Sushil Rane at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. I received my PhD in Neuroscience from Brown Univeristy in 2023, and my thesis focused on understanding the cellular and molecular changes that happen in the aging hypothalamus. I am broadly interested in how the hypothalamus coordinates energy homeostasis and how this differs between sexes and across the lifespan.
