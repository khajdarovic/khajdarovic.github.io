I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Webb Laboratory at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. I received my PhD in Neuroscience from Brown Univeristy in 2023, and my thesis focused on understanding the cellular and molecular changes that happen in the aging hypothalamus. I am broadly interested in genomics, aging, the hypothalamus, and the power of in vitro models to unlock the mysteries of the aging brain.
