I am a Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience at Brown University. I work in the laboratory of Dr. Ashley Webb, and my research focuses on understanding the cellular and molecular changes that happen in the aging hypothalamus. I am broadly interested in genomics, aging, the hypothalamus, and the power of in vitro models to unlock the mysteries of the aging brain.
